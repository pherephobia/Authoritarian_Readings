# Authoritarian_Readings
This reading list aims to provide an introduction to the dominant questions, theories, and empirical research on authoritarian regimes and democratization. The goals of the readings are to differentiate among varieties of dictatorships, identify governing strategies, and discern the long-term impacts of dictatorship on institutional and economic development. The readings primarily focus on broad differences in ruling styles and their relations to the survival of dictators and their regimes. We explore the several questions; First, how democracy and dictatorship can be defined and measured?; Second, how do we look at the different theories of the institutions in each regime and how do the institutions works with respect to their politico-socio-economic changes (e.g. transitions and consolidations)?; Third, how do the empirical evidences in favor of these theories?---regime types and their outcomes; Forth, how do we examine the theoretical and empirical literature on the politics of authoritarian regimes with appropriate methodology?
